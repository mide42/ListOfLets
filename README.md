# ReadMe file for *"ListOfLets"*

Started in March 2015.

Main document contains a list of names of software technologies ending with *"-let"*, e.g. App*LET* or Serv*LET*.

This repository contains only markdown files (for formatted text), but no source code for an executable computer program.

Referenced articles (e.g. Wikipedia articles) have to be in English, of course.
