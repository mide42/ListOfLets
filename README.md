<br>

Started in March 2015.

The [main document](https://github.com/mide42/ListOfLets/blob/master/ListOfLets.md) contains a list of names of *software technologies* or *software components* ending with *"-let"*, e.g. App*LET* or Serv*LET* (short URL: http://tinyurl.com/n4huhsv).

<br>

Further, the repository contains also the following word lists:
* [List of Query Languages](ListOfQueryLanguages.md)
* [List of Development Kits](ListOfDevelopmentKits.md)
* [List of Software Stacks](ListOfStacks.md)

<br>

This repository contains only markdown files (for formatted text), but no source code for an executable computer program.

Referenced articles (e.g., Wikipedia articles) have to be in English, of course.
